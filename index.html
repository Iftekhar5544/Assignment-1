            <p class="normal-text">Mission 2022 gave me work experience while learning more about a technical job, …
                learning how to develop website. I was also getting work experience working for Crunch
                which gave me a bit of direction in what to study. I would really recommend Mission 2022 to anybody.
                You are going to learn a lot, get a lot of confidence out of it. The greatest benefit was getting a job.
                That’s really the best feeling.</p>
